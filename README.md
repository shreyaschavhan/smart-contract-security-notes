## Smart Contract Security Notes

### Blockchain Basics

- What is blockchain?
> -  A blockchain is like a shared, secure, and tamper-proof digital diary that keeps a record of transactions or information, and it's maintained by a network of users rather than a single authority.
> -  A simple analogy would be "Google Doc".
> -  It's like a Google Doc that's constantly updated and shared with a group, ensuring transparency and security. Once information is added, it's there for everyone to see, and it's nearly impossible to change past entries without everyone noticing.
